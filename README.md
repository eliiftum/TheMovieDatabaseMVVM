# TheMovieDatabaseMVVM

## Features

 - I used MVVM design pattern 
 - Developed with UIKit.
 - API is https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=Lord+Of&api_key=
 - I made it with Storyboards
 - URLSession is used for Network Request
 - I used a generic type to be able to use all models in a single network layer.
 - I used the singleton architecture in all managers because it allows them to be instantiated only once and kept in memory throughout the application's lifetime.

   
## Third-Party Libraries
